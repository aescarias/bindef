# BinDef

BinDef (short for Binary Definition) is a declarative language for describing a binary file format. BinDef provides abstractions for validating magic signatures, reading structures, dealing with endianness, and more, under a simple JSON-like format.

This repository contains the reference BinDef implementation, written in Go.
